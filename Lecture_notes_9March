#REGULAR EXPRESSIONS:
import re
l = 'this is a string with some numbers 13 45'
numbers = re.findall('\d+',l)  # d = digital number, finds all the numbers in the string, saves it as a list

# can use regular expressions to compute stuff in a simple way 
# if you need it --> google is your friend


#SAVE TEXT FILES: 
df = pd.read_csv('<file_name>', header = 13)  #using pandas when you have csv file
df.write()

f = open('<file_name.txt>', 'w')   #creating new file
l = '''write something
       write more'''
f.write(l)
f.close

#CHANGE PLOT SIZE
plt.fig(figsize = [x,y])
